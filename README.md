I used pandas and matplotlib.pyplot to analyze and visualize snake bite cases in Nepal from fiscal year 2065/66 to 2073/74.
I visualized snake bite trends over the years, death percentage over the years, cure rate over the years and also analyzed average number of poisonous and non-poisonous bites per year.
